Generative Storytelling with Multi-Agent LLM System

This project explores the use of Generative AI and multi-agent large language models (LLMs) for collaborative storytelling.
It simulates a creative writing team composed of different AI agents that plan, write, and refine stories together.

Overview

The system employs a multi-agent architecture, where each agent specializes in a particular aspect of the creative process, such as:

Plot development

Character creation

Narrative consistency

Language refinement and editing

Through communication and iteration, the agents collaboratively produce coherent, contextually rich stories.

Features

Multi-agent coordination for narrative generation

Role-based prompt system for each agent

Automatic story revision and consistency checking

Configurable parameters for genre, tone, and style

Ready-to-run implementation in Google Colab

Use Cases
